# Mini-Project 7 : Blockchains

Author: **Dieu-Anh (Audrey) Trinh**, **Jinny Eo**

## Description
This program simulates the development of a blockchain that records the transactions between two parties, call them Alexis and Blake. 
Initially, Alexis starts with a non-negative amount of cash and no new cash is injected into the system. 
Each transaction is represented by a single integer that represents a transfer of money between Alexis and Blake. \
\
The first block of the chain stores the amount of money that Alexis starts with (think of it as an initial transaction from Blake to Alexis). 
Subsequent blocks of the chain only store the transactions between Alexis and Blake rather than the overall amount in the system.
